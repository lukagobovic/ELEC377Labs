The second document describes your testing. This includes a description of each test
case and how it confirms that your program works correctly. Both output and input

For this lab, the test cases are not exactly that obvious. The main "test cases" are running the process as a regular user, and running the process in ROOT. 
When run in ROOT, all the UIDs and GIDs were set to 0, where as when run with a student netid account, the values are all non-zero. Additionally, the other test cases
involved us running using the cat command, which populated the name field in the output file with "cat", and running using the more command, which populated the name 
field with "more". The output files are named lab1cat.txt and lab1more.txt, for the process being run on the student account, and lab1catROOT.txt and lab1moreROOT.txt for the
process being run on the ROOT.
