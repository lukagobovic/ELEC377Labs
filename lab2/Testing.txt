The main testing of the code consited of running the command: ./lab2main 3 1500.
This command, consting of two parameters, the number of monitor files to read and the number of msec that the printer routine needs to wait between loops.
The first value, is set at three since there are three machine text files to read, and the second number was set to 1500, as that is a value within
the range that was specified. 

For this lab, as we can see from comparing the output log to the given machine text files, when the machines are supposed to be down, a message
stating which machine is down will be printed. Additionally, when there is new data that comes in, and the reader thread runs, and new data is 
available again, the program outputs that the data has been overwritten. Both of the previous outputs allowed us to test if various parts of the 
code were functioning as expected, as if neither of these outputs showed up in the terminal, something serious would be wrong.

Some of the other statements in the terminal and output log file, outline generally what is going on with the various threads, i.e when the reader
thread is active, or when the lock to the crtical section is aquired. Again, these statements allow us to ensure the proper functionality of the program
