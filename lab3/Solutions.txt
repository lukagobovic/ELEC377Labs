Problem:
- The goal of the lab was to implement a simple shell program that can execute basic functions and run external programs

Solution:
- The program first takes the command buffer (the string that is inputted through the command line), identifies the start of each word,
  and places a pointer to it inside of the args array
  - A null terminator ('\0') is also placed at the end of each word
- The first element that is passed will always either be the name of a function or a file name
- With this knowledge, we first compare the first word against functions
  - If there is a match, then run the function and then prepare for another input
- If there is no match, then treat the first argument as a file name and attempt to open the file
  - If the file is opened successfully, then execute it, otherwise attempt to find the file with a different path prefix
- If the file is still not opened successfully, then the user did not enter a valid command or file name
  - Alert the user, and then prepare for another input
