To test our shell, we ran 4 seperate tests, producing 4 different output files, all testing seperate aspects of the shell
The first file, testSplitCommand.txt, was to test the ability of our shell to split the command line. Using the provided 
debugging code in the main function, the output file shows each of the arguments in the command line being split up, and 
appropriately indexed. At the end of each args array is the expected null character, and this is also outputted, with
each of the outputs ending with a 0. The output of the file validates the splitCommand line works as expected 

Next, we tested the embedded commands of our shell, these being pwd, cd, ls and exit. The output for this test can be 
found in testEmbeddedCommands.txt. First we tested the ls command to show the files in the current directory. The ls 
command showed all of the files currently in our lab3 folder, with the ls -a command being run next. This command shows
all the hidden files in the directory.
