To test this script, we used the two .out files provided to us which resulted in two seperate test cases. 
There are multiple output files, those being the 3 or 4 specific thread output files. In the .thread(0,1,2 or 3) 
files, only the traces corresponding to the certain thread, i.e 0,1 or 2, are in there. So the thread0 
file contains all the traces from machine 0, and so on. The other output files, the .reader and .printer 
files, contain only the traces corresponding to the reader and printer. This can be identified by the 
R that is found after the two digit number near the beginning of the trace. The file only contains traces with the R 
The same can be said for the printer file, where only the traces containing the P after the two digit number are in the file. 

As for the time span, to validate this, we take the timestamp of the first trace, and the last one, 
and subtract them. For example, in the reader file, the first timestamp is 1666976719.369965, and the 
last timestamp is 1666976741.431129. Using a calculator to subtract these, the answer is 22.061164, 
which when rounded to 2 decimal places results in a time span of 22.06, directly matching our calculation 
located at the end of the respective file.
